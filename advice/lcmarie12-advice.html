                <h4>Confusion is your friend &#38; Representation Matters!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <p> Confusion is an essential ingredient but you don't have to go it alone. Skillcrush has an amazing community
                  including a great team gitty to answer  your latest inquiries! BUT go beyond that! The web is not just home
                  to your next career but also someone walking in your shoes excited to tell you about the realities of the job,
                  advice they would tell their former struggling to learn selves, and tales of reality that the learning process
                  is forever. Tiff in Tech and Tina Huang are what helped be formulate my Why power and were the final puzzle piece
                  to help me go from I could maybe do this to --Let's do this!

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role, Your Why Power will Save You!!</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing. Be brave, Break the code. You can't fix what isn't broken and you
                  can't learn from what you haven't played with yourself. Don't get stuck in a rut of tutorials
                or a loop of self-doubt. Know your 'Why' because that will be the power that will pick you up when things get hard.
              You can learn hard things. Learning to code is a simple process, it's not easy-Your 'Why' will be what reminds you
            to take a break when all you want to do is quit.</p>
